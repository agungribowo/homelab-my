Installing Docker

First add the required dependencies and the security key:

sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
Make sure that the key fingerprint is 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88:

sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
Add the Docker repository corresponding to your CPU architecture and Operating System version (arch=arm64):

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=arm64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
If instead of a 64 bits OS, you want the 32 bits version (also covered by Raspberry Pi 4), you should change the reference to the architecture **in the previous command to [arch=armhf].

Finally update the repository sources:

sudo apt-get update
Also guarantee that you are about to install from the official Docker repository, instead of the default Ubuntu repo:

apt-cache policy docker-ce


We have finished setting up the repository!!

Then install Docker:

sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce
Check version

sudo docker -v
Add your user to docker group:

sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
So that this change takes effect you have log out and log in again.

Installing Docker Compose

This component **is avaible as a Python package that makes very easy its installation. First install the Python package manager:

sudo apt install python3-pip
Then install Docker Compose:

sudo pip3 install docker-compose
